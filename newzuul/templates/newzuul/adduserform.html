                So, we have to talk about a few things:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Listen, the zuul is a place where we trust each other. If you put money in, we trust you. But
                    if you don't put money in; please <strong>do not</strong> claim you did. You are allowed to have a negative
                    balance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have a negative balance, <strong>please</strong> pay if off before
                    the next zuul run. The Zuulmaster needs that money to buy more things and without it, we don't
                    have a zuul!
                </li>
                <li>
                    So let's review: Please only add money to your account if you actually dropped money in the
                    zuul bank. Please pay off negative balances before the next zuul run. Finally, if enough people
                    <strong>don't</strong> follow these rules, the zuul can't exist.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We trust that <strong>everyone</strong> follows these rules. Take them seriously before hitting the agree button...
                </li>
            </ol>

            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-block btn-primary">
                I agree to these terms and conditions
            </button>
        </div>
    </div>
</form>
